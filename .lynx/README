Lynx is a great text browser, but it's configuration files are a nightmare.

The global config (e.g., /etc/lynx.cfg) is overwritten by the local config
(~/.lynx.cfg) which is in turn sometimes overwritten by the local rc
(~/.lynxrc) and always overwritten by any command line options.

Despite this, its vi-like keybinds, link hinting and mass availability is
really hard to beat!

For a quick and dirty lynx session, run:

 $ lynx -vikeys -tna -nocolor -number_fields [url]
